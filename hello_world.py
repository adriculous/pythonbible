# single quotes (') or double quotes (") are ok either way

hello = 'Hello world!'

print(hello)

# use single quotes (') if your string includes a quote ('He said, " You're awesome! " ')

# use triple quotes (''') if your string is a paragraph or long sentences. ('''blah blah blah... long text blah...''')
