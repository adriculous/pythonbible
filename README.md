# Projects from the Udemy Class: "The Python Bible" by Ziyad Yehia
URL: https://www.udemy.com/the-python-bible

This is a collection of mini-projects I've created using basic Python, from its super-basics to the basics of object oriented programming.

I still don't feel confident in becoming a PyLady (python programmer lady) just yet, so I'm going to get into building more projects outside the course so I can practice.

Thank you very much for stopping by!
